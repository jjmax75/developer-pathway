# Developer Pathway

This is a resource to follow for becoming a fullstack Javascript developer.

The technologiers used aren't really important but Node and React are good choices for now (Nov 2020).

Fork this repo.

This is a work in progress. The goal is to flesh out each of the sections with more detail but not to make this an overly directive resource, it is more a guide.

The goal is to get you to a level where you can confidently go to an interview and clearly communicate where you're at as a developer. You won't know everything but will have a solid foundation, good portfolio pieces and confidence in your ability.

This resource will be purposefully sparse. There is a wealth of information out there about becoming a proficient developer. The aim here is to get down to the brass tacks of what you'll need to get a job as a developer using Javascript.

I jsut went looking for "skills you need as a developer in 2020" hoping to find one of those posts that lists tonnes of technologies so I could say "ignore that, you only need a few of those". Instead I found this [skillcrush article](https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/) which pretty much nails it at the end:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Ideally, one or more third-party library like ReactJS or Angular
- Programming languages and libraries like Ruby, PHP, Python
- Experience with databases
- Version control
- Knowledge of security concerns and best practices
- Ideally, some knowledge of web or visual design, plus user experience best practices

Get comofrtable with those and you're on your way. We'll focus on React and Node.
